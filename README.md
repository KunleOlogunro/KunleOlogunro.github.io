Since I began to write, I have always used a pen and a paper, or my mobile phone. In my four years of university, I used my phone for writing and typing related exercises, and for my final year project, a friend lent me his laptop. 

I have just graduated, and I intend to take on more writing exercises. I also hope to go into translation, content creation and management, and developing my skill set by learning how to use applications like Canva, Mail Chimp, Google Docs, Microsoft Word tools, among others. In the next year too, I hope to have the first draft of my novel ready.

Having a laptop would really ease my workload and help me achieve my goals faster. Your donations will really go a long way.

Thank you for reading this, and thank you for helping out.
